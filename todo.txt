To Do:

- operator()
	- auto f = x+y*y;
	- f[x==3 & y==1].val();
	- f(x==3 & y==1)
	
	- auto g = x*x+x;
	- g(4)
- add functions:
	pow, exp, log, sin, cos, tan, etc
- derivatives (figure out multiple dispatch with templated types)
	- maybe instead make deriv an operator and use simplify?
- simplify
	- simple version in place
- match (necessary for integration)
- integration (see Risch algorithm)
- parse from string?
- add matrix support
- check/add support for std::complex

Much later:
- optimization
- distributions
