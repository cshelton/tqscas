Current (miopic) list:
	- Add "switch" rewrites to scalarrewrite.hpp
	- Redo der and int to be operators with rewrite rules and (numeric) evals
	- Add specialization of rewrites by list of vars

Longer / Maybe:
	- fix conversion of constant to expr 
	- Add ability of mathces to pertain only to a particular type
	- Add "domain" of exprs
	- Add comparison operators (maybe redo switches in that case?)
	- Add "min" and "max" to scalars (using switches)
	- Add matrices
	- Add ranges / sets ?
