Current (miopic) list:
	* Redo der and int to be operators with rewrite rules and (numeric) evals
	- Add specialization of rewrites by list of vars

Longer / Maybe:
	- fix conversion of constant to expr (??)
	- Add ability of ops to pertain only to a particular type (for real)
	- Add "domain" of exprs
	- Add comparison operators (maybe redo switches in that case?)
	- Add "min" and "max" to scalars (using switches)
	- Add matrices
	* Add ranges / sets ? (partially done)
	- Add trig functions (or just use complex numbers?)

Done:
	- Add "switch" rewrites to scalarrewrite.hpp
	- Add "local scope"
	- add abs as base function 
	- convert "switch" to multiplication by step-indicator fn
